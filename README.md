TicketManager
=============
TicketManager is a module for Zikula 1.3.x. It can be used to dynamically generate great looking event-tickets. These tickets are generated as pdfs using [TCPDF](http://www.tcpdf.org). Every ticket contains an unique qr-code to make it possible to identify each ticket. To check if a ticket is valid, scan the qr-code either with an smartphone app or something like [zbarcam](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/zbarcam.1.html) (Linux). You will get a message indicating weather a ticket is valid or not.

See the wiki for further information: [TicketManager wiki](http://github.com/cmfcmf/TicketManager/wiki).

### **This module needs the [TCPDF Systemplugin](https://github.com/cmfcmf/Tcpdf-zk)!**
